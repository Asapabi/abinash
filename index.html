          <p>I am a gradute from EBS Universität für Wirtschaft und Recht. I received my Bachelor oof Science in General Management and am planning to start a career in Strategy Consulting. In my studies at EBS I focused more on Strategy, Entrepreneurship, Innovation, Corporate Governance and Competition Policy. I wrote my thesis about the impact of artificial intelligence in professional service firms and proposed the hypothesis that in five years management consulting firms will internally implement and use operating artificial intelligence systems as virtual assistants. I already gained experience in project management, business development, investment consulting with a focus on tangible assets. Currently I am a research and management assistant at EBS SITE Institute and EBS Marketing Department. </p>
